## 🌟 Overview

### The assignment 🎯

This week's assignment was an introduction to Business Intelligence using Power BI.

The purpose was to gain hands-on practice as outlined below:

1. Understand domain-specific business and client needs
2. Load data
3. Transform data
4. Build DAX
5. Visualize a dashboard
6. Publish the project

We were to personalize our Power BI analysis and dashboards, ensuring that we:

1. **Load and Transform various datasets**
2. **Build the Data Model:** use the star schema to build the underlying data model and the required relationships
3. **Data Analysis Expressions:** create new columns and measures using DAX expressions that will be useful in creating visualizations.
4. **Dashboard:** create a compelling and interactive dashboard report from the analysis of the dataset that would speak clearly to the business needs for decision making.
5. **Publish and Share:** share the final Power BI dashboard.
